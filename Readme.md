This is a project that I did as homework while attending the QA Automation bootcamp by Digital Skola.
SuperTest is a library in Node.js that helps Developers/QA test API. SuperTest can be used as a standalone library or with
JavaScript testing frameworks such as Mocha or Jest.
This project is an example of API tests using:
1. [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
2. [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome)
3. [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

This API Automation using (https://restful-api.dev/) as a system.

## Getting Started:

You need to have the following installed in your machine:

2. npm. npm install -g npm
3. `mocha` framework is used for writing tests and `chai` for assertions, following command should help to install the required npm packages:
   - Install supertest package: `npm install supertest --save-dev`
